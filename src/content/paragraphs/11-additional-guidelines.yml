  ## Tonality of written communication

  ### Quality

  All texts should convey the level of quality that SFA represents. They should be well-written, concise, and pleasant to read. Our advice is to pay for editing and proofreading of all texts that will be published, if they are not going to be written by a copywriter. Choose British or American English for all your texts and be consistent. Choose your writers accordingly.
 
  ### Values and underlying messaging

  The tone of voice for SFA should be convey the following:  
  Reliability (we’re experienced, honest, and unbiased)  
  Inspiration (we’re fresh, fun, and passionate about sustainable fashion)  
  Purpose (we’re providing valuable, sustainable solutions for the industry)  
  Pedagogy (we’re here to provide important knowledge and teach you important skills)  
  Personal (you’re a part of the ‘sustainable fashion community’. We’re delighted you’re here!)  
 
  ### Informal versus formal language

  Do not imitate spoken language in written text (Hey! What’s up?).  
  Choose a level of formality that feels natural and honest. Often, an organization’s mission can be an indicator of a ‘natural level’ of formality.
  
  "The Sustainable Fashion Academy’s vision is an apparel industry that creates happier people, stronger communities, and a resilient planet. SFA’s mission is to accelerate the industry innovations needed to ensure this happens. To this end, SFA equips leaders and entrepreneurs working at different levels within the industry with the knowledge and tools they need to develop and drive sustainable apparel innovations."
 
  The use of colloquial language will date your copy. An expression that is popular and relevant now may not be so in a year’s time. The same goes for cultural references. Choose them very carefully.   
  Dialectic language and slang is not appropriate since your participants are going to come from different geographic locations and be a mix of ages and backgrounds.
 
  ### Less is more. Say what you need to say and remove anything that isn’t essential.

  Avoid repetition. If you repeat, justify why you are repeating. ("The importance of washing fabrics in cold water can not be stressed enough.")  
  Short sentences are better than long sentences, which require a sophisticated level of grammar if written correctly. They are also easier to read. Keep things clear and simple.
 
  ### Technical language

  Of course, technical terms are needed because they are very specific in their meaning. However, wherever possible, consider using everyday language that all your audience will understand.   
  Using simple language can also inspire a sense of trust and intimacy with your audience, which is ideal for the SFA brand.
 
  ### Whenever possible, tell stories

  "Storytelling is a way of presenting information about your company in a way that resonates on an emotional level with your audience. It’s also a way of turning an otherwise chaotic bundle of information into something more coherent, where the story arc gives direction as the reader is led from one idea to the next."
 
  ### Use of Pronouns and other Grammar choices
 
  Invest in a simple and easy to read grammar book or online resource and stick to it. All texts should  follow the same grammar rules. Consistency is very important.  
  For example: The choice of pronouns can make a marked difference, setting up the nature of the relationship between SFA and participants. Make choices that feel natural and apply them to all texts.  
 
  Example: "We believe in you." vs. "Our organisation believes in its students."
 
  ### Create a SFA Language Guide

  Appoint someone within the organization to govern this project (tonality) if you do not hire a copywriter. Budget native speaking proofreading and have them follow and maintain the SFA language guide. It will expand over time— don’t rush to fill it, just keep it updated and apply your choices to all texts.  
  A language guide is based on anything that helps maintain text consistency and enhances your brand.
 
  ### Suggestions

  Maintain a lists of words and phrases that you like versus those you don’t like.  
  Choose and be consistent about terms you will be repeating, acronyms, how numbers are written, when capital letters are used, spelling (after choosing US vs American English), and titles.
