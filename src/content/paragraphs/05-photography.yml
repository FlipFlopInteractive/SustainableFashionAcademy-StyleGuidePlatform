  We have selected a range of photographs which indicates the feeling and tonality to be used.

  The feeling and tonality within photography can be described as: images that have a natural color tone and are compositioned within the rules of third. People should have various ethnic backgrounds to emphasize internationality. Objects should have an everyday feel to them to be very recognizable.

  We believe a strong and simple photography style in combination with the natural color tones will add to the sustainable character of our brand identity.
