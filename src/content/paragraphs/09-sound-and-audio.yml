  ### Voicing
  
  A expressed preference for a female British voice for the majority of the voicing supports the developing graphic profile. A male voice, perhaps Swedish speaking English, would also be fitting.

  Reference and suggested resource for female British voicing (Flip-Flop will provide this talent if wanted):  
  Miranda: [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xya6aLjwmMA ]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xya6aLjwmMA )
 
  Miranda is a RADA-trained English actress married to a Swede and living in Stockholm with her husband and their 2 girls. She has considerable experience on the London stage and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2001/2002 with whom she played several lead roles.  She has been fortunate to work with some of the UK's leading directors including Rupert Goold, Greg Doran and Sean Holmes; she was also part of the first production of Tom Stoppard's award-winning play Rock n Roll - directed by Trevor Nunn.  She has extensive experience in radio drama for BBC Radio 4 and has done several voiceovers over the course of her career.  She is also a singer specializing in both the classical and "crossover"/cabaret genres.
 
 
  ### Music
 
  We recommend:  
  Music rather than song, since since lyrics will distract from your intense informational content and could possibly interfere with your brand. Choosing a SFA tune to enhance the SFA brand and using it sparingly in ‘neutral’ spaces. Any choices of music to be used in video produced at a later date should be similar in style and sound to the ‘SFA tune" and ideally, be a part of the same production. Free music downloads mean limited choices, but there are good options that will serve your purposes well. We would be happy to provide three suggested examples of music once we have an approved and finalised graphic profile. We will also provide free music download references.
