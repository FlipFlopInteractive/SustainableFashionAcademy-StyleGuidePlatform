  ## Tonality of written communication

  ### Quality

  All texts should convey the level of quality that SFA represents. They should be well-written, concise, and pleasant to read. Our advice is to pay for editing and proofreading of all texts that will be published, if they are not going to be written by a copywriter. Choose British or American English for all your texts and be consistent. Choose your writers accordingly.
 
  ### Values and underlying messaging

  The tone of voice for SFA should be convey the following:  
  Reliability (we’re experienced, honest, and unbiased)
  Inspiration (we’re fresh, fun, and passionate about sustainable fashion)
  Purpose (we’re providing valuable, sustainable solutions for the industry)
  Pedagogy (we’re here to provide important knowledge and teach you important skills)
  Personal (you’re a part of the ‘sustainable fashion community’. We’re delighted you’re here!)
 
  ### Informal versus formal language

  Do not imitate spoken language in written text (Hey! What’s up?).  
  Choose a level of formality that feels natural and honest. Often, an organization’s mission can be an indicator of a ‘natural level’ of formality.
  
  "The Sustainable Fashion Academy’s vision is an apparel industry that creates happier people, stronger communities, and a resilient planet. SFA’s mission is to accelerate the industry innovations needed to ensure this happens. To this end, SFA equips leaders and entrepreneurs working at different levels within the industry with the knowledge and tools they need to develop and drive sustainable apparel innovations."
 
  The use of colloquial language will date your copy. An expression that is popular and relevant now may not be so in a year’s time. The same goes for cultural references. Choose them very carefully.   
  Dialectic language and slang is not appropriate since your participants are going to come from different geographic locations and be a mix of ages and backgrounds.
 
  ### Less is more. Say what you need to say and remove anything that isn’t essential.

  Avoid repetition. If you repeat, justify why you are repeating. (“The importance of washing fabrics in cold water can not be stressed enough.”)  
  Short sentences are better than long sentences, which require a sophisticated level of grammar if written correctly. They are also easier to read. Keep things clear and simple.
 
  ### Technical language

  Of course, technical terms are needed because they are very specific in their meaning. However, wherever possible, consider using everyday language that all your audience will understand.   
  Using simple language can also inspire a sense of trust and intimacy with your audience, which is ideal for the SFA brand.
 
  ### Whenever possible, tell stories

  "Storytelling is a way of presenting information about your company in a way that resonates on an emotional level with your audience. It’s also a way of turning an otherwise chaotic bundle of information into something more coherent, where the story arc gives direction as the reader is led from one idea to the next."
 
  ### Use of Pronouns and other Grammar choices
 
  Invest in a simple and easy to read grammar book or online resource and stick to it. All texts should  follow the same grammar rules. Consistency is very important.  
  For example: The choice of pronouns can make a marked difference, setting up the nature of the relationship between SFA and participants. Make choices that feel natural and apply them to all texts.  
 
  Example: “We believe in you.” vs. “Our organisation believes in its students.”
 
  ### Create a SFA Language Guide

  Appoint someone within the organization to govern this project (tonality) if you do not hire a copywriter. Budget native speaking proofreading and have them follow and maintain the SFA language guide. It will expand over time— don’t rush to fill it, just keep it updated and apply your choices to all texts.  
  A language guide is based on anything that helps maintain text consistency and enhances your brand.
 
  ### Suggestions

  Maintain a lists of words and phrases that you like versus those you don’t like.  
  Choose and be consistent about terms you will be repeating, acronyms, how numbers are written, when capital letters are used, spelling (after choosing US vs American English), and titles.




  ## Animation Style
 
  We recommend a “water color” style for your animation. The following style would be in keeping with your values and the developing graphic profile because it is:  
  aesthetically pleasing  
  speaks to clothing and fabric design and creation  
  does not speak more to fashion than outdoor apparel or vice-versa  
  speaks to any economic segment or geographic location  
  is modern and current, but also timeless




  ## Sound and Audio
 
  ### Voicing
  
  A expressed preference for a female British voice for the majority of the voicing supports the developing graphic profile. A male voice, perhaps Swedish speaking English, would also be fitting.

  Reference and suggested resource for female British voicing (Flip-Flop will provide this talent if wanted):  
  Miranda: [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xya6aLjwmMA ]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xya6aLjwmMA )
 
  Miranda is a RADA-trained English actress married to a Swede and living in Stockholm with her husband and their 2 girls. She has considerable experience on the London stage and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2001/2002 with whom she played several lead roles.  She has been fortunate to work with some of the UK's leading directors including Rupert Goold, Greg Doran and Sean Holmes; she was also part of the first production of Tom Stoppard's award-winning play Rock n Roll - directed by Trevor Nunn.  She has extensive experience in radio drama for BBC Radio 4 and has done several voiceovers over the course of her career.  She is also a singer specializing in both the classical and "crossover"/cabaret genres.
 
 
  ### Music
 
  We recommend:  
  Music rather than song, since since lyrics will distract from your intense informational content and could possibly interfere with your brand. Choosing a SFA tune to enhance the SFA brand and using it sparingly in ‘neutral’ spaces. Any choices of music to be used in video produced at a later date should be similar in style and sound to the ‘SFA tune” and ideally, be a part of the same production. Free music downloads mean limited choices, but there are good options that will serve your purposes well. We would be happy to provide three suggested examples of music once we have an approved and finalised graphic profile. We will also provide free music download references.
