description:	|
  Our color world is grounded in the industry we are in. The featured color scheme reflects our - over time build up - brand image. Red stands for the passion and impact of the brand, accompanied by a complementary saturated green and beige color that stand for sustainability and reliability. Black is prefered to be used within typography.

  We have selected these colors to be used individual or in combination of each other. Both approuches to support the communication issue at hand, but equally recognizable as part of the Sustainable Fashion Academy brand.

  Other colors are not permitted - this in order to maintain consitencty throughout the brand identity.
